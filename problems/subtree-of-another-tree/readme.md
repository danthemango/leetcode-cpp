Example 1:
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000].
The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-104 <= root.val <= 104
-104 <= subRoot.val <= 104
